100,yeah nicky loved restaurants he was a real restaurant buff and over the years he always made money with them i gotta do somethin' i gotta do somethin' they ain't gettin' rid of me they're not gettin' rid of me i'm staying here fuck 'em fuck 'em, casino 
101,in so many words yes in other words i'm fucked, casino 
102,let's say for instance i want to go in the restaurant which happens to be in the casino to get one of those sandwiches i like nope there's no way, casino 
103,yeah i believe it you got banned ' detrimental to gaming and he will be ejected from any casino in las vegas and the casinos can be fined as much as a hundred thousand every time he shows up ' do you believe this shit, casino 
104,well it wasn't long before what i was afraid was gonna happen happened nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in las vegas and from then on i couldn't be seen talkin' to him anywhere in vegas or even near it all right, casino 
105,what am i doin' out here i'm tryin' to make a livin' that's all bullshit or no bullshit they put you in that book you're gonna be in a lot of trouble you will not be able to walk into the casino i'm tellin' you, casino 
106,i'm i'm hearin' things from security they're all ex cops the sheriff's lookin' to bust your balls they want to put you in the black book why somebody's complaining, casino 
107,between hey i gotta give the guy credit he does the most obvious thing this is the only town in the country where a bookie joint is legit so why not take advantage right so he took bookie joints off the street and then opened them up inside the casino well within a few years by doin' all of this he had every casino on the strip trying to copy off him, casino 
108,but i'll tell you he knew how to bring in the crowds he knew all the fuckin' angles he brought over the whole 'femme fatale' show from paris but he forgot how lazy them european dancin' broads can get i mean he had to weigh 'em in once a week to make sure they didn't blow up like fuckin' balloons thanks pal, casino 
109,all right ace i'm sorry about this really, casino 
110,what ho hey come here so what do you think i do i threw that cocksucker out, casino 
111,what and he tells me to go fuck myself, casino

113,so i'm lucky i'm not allowed to get lucky in this place be careful gaming agents are all over the place, casino 
114,four aces doc and i didn't want any of those agents near my place, casino 
115,the next thing i did i started bustin' out high stakes poker players to begin i put money out on the streets chargin' three points a week you know juice to the fuckin' dealers, casino 
116,it was typical ace he invited the biggest people in town and he knew they'd show because he knew they all wanted somethin' from him with ace nobody ever got a free ride even ginger with her when i married ginger i knew all the stories but i didn't give a fuck 'i'm sam rothstein ' i said 'i can change her ', casino 
117,especially at the casino where he definitely did not work people got the message and nicky being nicky he made his presence known, casino 
118,yeah he had a fool proof scheme all right it wasn't very scientific but it worked when he won he collected when he lost he told the bookies to go fuck themselves what were they gonna do muscle nicky nicky was the muscle but i saw it another i saw it as untouched i mean they had bookies pimps and drug dealers i could shake down who the fuck were they gonna run to so i started getting everybody in line best of all for the first time in my life i figured out a way not to lose, casino 
119,nick i gotta tell you i got pinched twice for no reason you really gotta be careful i'm running a licensed place everything's legit i don't care i want to get away from back home for a while i'm tired of that shit back there look at this place it's made of money you know what the best part is nobody's gonna know what we're doin' there's nobody here to see us everybody's back home, casino 
120,you mean i have your permission no of course not, casino 
121,after we ate we left jennifer and ginger alone and we took a ride to talk and then he hit me with it honey come here, casino 
122,ginger yeah, casino 
123,okay sammy hey, casino 
124,i mean he took care of himself only too well and that's why every badge back home wanted to nail him you find any cash in there we'll whack it up with you, casino 
125,listen while i was tryin' to figure out why the guy was sayin' what he was sayin' nicky just hit him no matter how big a guy might be nicky would take him on you beat nicky with fists he comes back with a bat you beat him with a knife he comes back with a gun and you beat him with a gun you better kill him because he'll keep comin' back and back until one of you is dead, casino 
126,what's that you hear you hear a little girl frankie you hear a little girl ace is that a little fuckin' girl what happened to the fuckin' tough guy told my friend stick it up his fuckin' ass huh huh if he don't know nobody knows told you it was eight, casino

128,yeah we made a great pair i made book and nicky made sure we always collected the old men loved us and why not they all made money with us if his girlfriend was knocked up, casino 
129,place the checks properly that's the way you do it he bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon, casino 
130,you know havin' some fun with it shit like that you know i don't know if i could do this even if i wanted to the gaming commission would never give me a license i have at least two dozen gambling and bookmaking pinches on me, casino 
131,got a lot of holes in the desert and a lot of problems are buried in those holes except you gotta do it right i mean you gotta have the hole already dug before you show up with a package in the trunk otherwise you're talkin' about a half hour or forty five minutes of diggin' and who knows who's gonna be comin' along in that time before you know it you gotta dig a few more holes you could be there all fuckin' night but it's in the desert where lots of the town's problems are solved, casino

136,before we point the dirty end of the stick at 'ol don uh we better be sure we can prove them charges i'm sorry but he knew about our gettin' hit on three big machines in a row and he did nothing about it that means either he was in on it or forgive me for saying this he was too dumb to see what was going on either way i cannot have a man like that workin' here, casino
