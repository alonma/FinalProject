151,it just didn't sink into his head about the black book and what it meant not being able to go into a casino is just one thing but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and fbi agent in the state i mean you're listed in there with al capone but nicky didn't care in so many words yes, casino 
152,in other words i'm fucked forget it you can't even set foot in the parking lot that's how serious it is, casino 
153,let's say for instance i want to go in the restaurant which happens to be in the casino to get one of those sandwiches i like nope there's no way, casino 
154,motherfucker unsavory fuckin' is there any way around this yeah i believe it you got banned, casino 
155,' detrimental to gaming and he will be ejected from any casino in las vegas and the casinos can be fined as much as a hundred thousand every time he shows up ' do you believe this shit what the fuck is that supposed to mean, casino 
156,well it wasn't long before what i was afraid was gonna happen happened nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in las vegas and from then on i couldn't be seen talkin' to him anywhere in vegas or even near it all right, casino 
157,i'm just tellin' you don't say i didn't warn you what am i doin' out here i'm tryin' to make a livin' that's all, casino 
158,bullshit or no bullshit they put you in that book you're gonna be in a lot of trouble you will not be able to walk into the casino i'm tellin' you that black book is a bunch of bullshit they got two names in there for the whole country and one of them is still al capone, casino 
159,i'm i'm hearin' things from security they're all ex cops the sheriff's lookin' to bust your balls they want to put you in the black book why somebody's complaining, casino 
160,you better watch yourself there's a lot of heat on you already between, casino 
161,hey i gotta give the guy credit he does the most obvious thing this is the only town in the country where a bookie joint is legit so why not take advantage right so he took bookie joints off the street and then opened them up inside the casino well within a few years by doin' all of this he had every casino on the strip trying to copy off him you're still eight pounds over what's the reason for this, casino 
162,but i'll tell you he knew how to bring in the crowds he knew all the fuckin' angles he brought over the whole 'femme fatale' show from paris but he forgot how lazy them european dancin' broads can get i mean he had to weigh 'em in once a week to make sure they didn't blow up like fuckin' balloons thanks pal, casino 
163,okay all right ace, casino 
164,i'm sorry about this really if he does it again he's out for good i don't care what it is nick i'm gonna ha i'll i'll never let him in the place again, casino 
165,what ho hey come here so what do you think i do i threw that cocksucker out, casino 
166,then he called me a faggot what, casino 
167,and he tells me to go fuck myself he insulted billy and then i walked over to him politely, casino 
168,no no i didn't know that but you know what he did, casino 
169,you been lucky all week they're lookin' to nail ya so i'm lucky i'm not allowed to get lucky in this place, casino 
170,be careful gaming agents are all over the place i mean nicky's a made guy and i'm not i can't do that, casino 
171,four aces doc and i didn't want any of those agents near my place, casino 
172,it was so obvious i mean all of nicky's half assed mechanics they were real signal happy the next thing i did i started bustin' out high stakes poker players, casino 
173,to begin i put money out on the streets chargin' three points a week you know juice to the fuckin' dealers nicky was dreamin' his own kind of vegas, casino 
174,it was typical ace he invited the biggest people in town and he knew they'd show because he knew they all wanted somethin' from him with ace nobody ever got a free ride even ginger with her when i married ginger i knew all the stories but i didn't give a fuck 'i'm sam rothstein ' i said 'i can change her ', casino 
175,me that's why the bosses sent me out here they wanted me to make sure none of the other crews robbed the joint like these two fuckin' balloon heads over here eddy and jerry they were gonna try and bang us out of two hundred fuckin' grand yeah right i'm sure especially at the casino where he definitely did not work people got the message, casino 
176,and nicky being nicky he made his presence known ohh, casino 
177,yeah he had a fool proof scheme all right it wasn't very scientific but it worked when he won he collected when he lost he told the bookies to go fuck themselves what were they gonna do muscle nicky nicky was the muscle but i saw it another i saw it as untouched i mean they had bookies pimps and drug dealers i could shake down who the fuck were they gonna run to so i started getting everybody in line best of all for the first time in my life i figured out a way not to lose, casino 
178,don't worry about it i'm not gonna do anything what am i gonna do i'm especially not gonna involve you in anything nick i gotta tell you i got pinched twice for no reason you really gotta be careful i'm running a licensed place everything's legit, casino 
179,i don't care i want to get away from back home for a while i'm tired of that shit back there look at this place it's made of money you know what the best part is nobody's gonna know what we're doin' there's nobody here to see us everybody's back home sure you have my permission but i i just gotta tell you it's no joke out here it's no joke you know you gotta keep a low profile it's not like back home right off the bat they don't like guys like us and this sheriff's a real cowboy even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here, casino 
180,you mean i have your permission no of course not, casino 
181,what do you think about me movin' out here what's the matter you got a problem with that after we ate we left jennifer and ginger alone and we took a ride to talk and then he hit me with it, casino

183,ginger yeah, casino 
184,somethin' huh okay sammy, casino 
185,hey nobody interfered with the fuckin' skim, casino

187,but nobody had to take care of nicky listen, casino 
188,while i was tryin' to figure out why the guy was sayin' what he was sayin' nicky just hit him no matter how big a guy might be nicky would take him on you beat nicky with fists he comes back with a bat you beat him with a knife he comes back with a gun and you beat him with a gun you better kill him because he'll keep comin' back and back until one of you is dead wait a sec nicky nicky nicky ta take it easy, casino

193,i'll take columbia for twenty place the checks properly that's the way you do it, casino 
194,he bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon where the hell did you learn how to deal, casino 
195,you know havin' some fun with it shit like that you know i don't know if i could do this even if i wanted to the gaming commission would never give me a license i have at least two dozen gambling and bookmaking pinches on me, casino 
196,give him a shot at runnin' a casino and he tries to talk you out of it got a lot of holes in the desert and a lot of problems are buried in those holes except you gotta do it right i mean you gotta have the hole already dug before you show up with a package in the trunk otherwise you're talkin' about a half hour or forty five minutes of diggin' and who knows who's gonna be comin' along in that time before you know it you gotta dig a few more holes you could be there all fuckin' night, casino
